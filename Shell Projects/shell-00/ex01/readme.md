## Exercise 01

The **ls** command is used to display information about files and directories on the computer and can be used in two formats: **short** and **long**.

In short mode, the command lists only the names of files and directories in the current folder, separated by a space.

```
❯ ls
ex00  ex01  ex02  ex03	ex04  ex05  ex06  ex07	ex08  ex09
```

In long mode, it lists files and directories separated by a line break and provides not only the name but also various other pieces of information.


```
❯ ls -l
total 40
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 13:22 ex00
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 18:43 ex01
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 10:30 ex02
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 10:32 ex03
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 10:40 ex04
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 10:46 ex05
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 10:51 ex06
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 11:49 ex07
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 11:27 ex08
drwxrwxr-x 2 leticia-aguiar leticia-aguiar 4096 Sep 11 11:48 ex09
```

> **💡 man ls**

> **💡 What does each column above represent?**

In this exercise, you will learn what information we need to know and what configurations we need to make when working with files in the Unix environment. Next, we will learn another very important and useful command for everyday use: the **tar** command.

> **💡 man tar**
