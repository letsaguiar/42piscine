## Exercise 00

This is a simple exercise. You only need to create a file and write a capital "Z" inside. The most direct way is to create the file with the **touch** command and then use a text editor like nano or vim to add the "Z" inside.

> **ðŸ’¡ man touch**

Take the opportunity to learn more about the different text editors (nano, vim, and vscode). Understand the differences between them, choose one you prefer, and learn about shortcuts, motions, etc.

Another option is to use the **echo** command and save its output to the file requested by the project.

```
echo "Z" > z
```

> **ðŸ’¡ man echo**

> **ðŸ’¡ What is the difference between ">" and ">>" ?**
